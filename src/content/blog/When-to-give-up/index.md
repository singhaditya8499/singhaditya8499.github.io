Is there a scale or value which dictates that its time to give up!

I saw this tag of FFT while solving a problem. FFT is fast fourier transform, which helps to multiply polynomial in 
O(nlogn) time complexity (one of its use case). I read about it in detail and then picked up another problem to implement FFT which would give confidence to solve these kind of problem in future. Its been 2 days and I am still not able to solve the problem. I realised maybe its time to give up on this problem and look for its solution, but on the other hand it feels that I am very close to solving it. I am not able to decide whether to give up or keep pushing myself. Is there an algorithm to know or a parameter to judge, so that we know that its time to give up!

We experience situation which isn't working for us and we wonder if I should persevere a little longer, afterall we always hear people saying "Never give up!". Staying too long with something not showing desired result can take away other aspects of your life. Even Isaac Newton wasted several years of his life chasing the secret code hidden in Bible to convert lead to gold. If he had known the algorithm or a parameter to know when is the time to give up, he could have made several other discoveries.

I understand numbers and figures better than anything. I researched about finding a quantitative value to determine the near accurate time for giving up, but every search query somehow finally take me to **n signs its time to give up on your crush** results. I am not able to find anything concrete which can distinguish the line between giving up and staying put.

Its pretty funny that I am not able to end this post. Afterall, it's not neccessary to complete every post, every story or solve every problem. I will define the perfect ending/solution. Till then I am not giving up! Happy FFT.
